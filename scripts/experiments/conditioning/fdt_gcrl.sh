# Template for running an sbatch arrayjob with a file containing a list of
# commands to run. Copy this, remove the .template, and edit as you wish to
# fit your needs.
#
# Assuming this file has been edited and renamed slurm_arrayjob.sh, here's an
# example usage:
# ```
# EXPT_FILE=experiments.txt  # <- this has a command to run on each line
# NR_EXPTS=`cat ${EXPT_FILE} | wc -l`
# MAX_PARALLEL_JOBS=12
# sbatch --array=1-${NR_EXPTS}%${MAX_PARALLEL_JOBS} slurm_arrayjob.sh $EXPT_FILE
# ```
#
# or, equivalently and as intended, with provided `run_experiement`:
# ```
# run_experiment -b slurm_arrayjob.sh -e experiments.txt -m 12
# ```

# Maximum number of nodes to use for the job

# Generic resources to use - typically you'll want gpu:n to get n gpus
#SBATCH --gres=gpu:1

# Megabytes of RAM required. Check `cluster-status` for node configurations
# #SBATCH --mem=14000

# Number of CPUs to use. Check `cluster-status` for node configurations
